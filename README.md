# Discord Rich Presence

This is a simple little script that periodically pulls Rich Presence data from an endpoint and sets it on the current user. This was designed to integrate with [RoboJack](https://github.com/Jack-Gledhill/robojack), which pulls data from my Google Calendar to show people what I'm currently doing.
